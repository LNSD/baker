## Supported Rust Versions

This repository is built against the latest stable release. The minimum supported
version is **1.66**. The current version is not guaranteed to build on Rust versions
earlier than the minimum supported version.

This project follows the same compiler support policies as the Tokio ecosystem.
The current stable Rust compiler and the three most recent minor versions before
it will always be supported. For example, if the current stable compiler version
is 1.69, the minimum supported version will not be increased past 1.66, three minor
versions prior. Increasing the minimum supported compiler version is not considered
a semantic versioning breaking change as long as doing so complies with this policy.
